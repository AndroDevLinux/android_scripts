                                                    THE MASTER PLAN

TODO: 
- Final checks ands devices syncs
-- ALPHA BUILD!!!
     Fix A2DP:
	      _95A31_: but you should be able to not care about avrcp 1.3 metadata, also those extensions for map etc,  this supported by android and bluez for android
	      _95A31_:  what you need to do is prepare an alsa plugin that would be loaded by media stack this plugin must implemented our audio ipc,  you can have a look at android/hal-audio.c for reference
	      _95A31_: I'd also leave qos handling for future
	      _95A31_: alternative option would be to make OMX (this is used on ste novathor plaatform, right?) use android audio hal instead of alsa for a2dp
